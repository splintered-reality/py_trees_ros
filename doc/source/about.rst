About
=====

ROS Py Trees extends the `py_trees`_ package with wrappers, patterns
and debugging tools for use in ROS.

If you are new to behaviour trees, start with the
:ref:`py_trees documentation <pt:introduction-section>`, browse
through a few of the readings and try the demos contained therein.

The documentation here includes the module level api documentation and
instructions for the command line utilities. 

For a set of tutorials that walk through the construction of a behaviour tree
for a typical robot application, refer to the documentation included with the
`py_trees_ros_tutorials`_ package. It also demonstrates use of the
py_trees visualisation software.
