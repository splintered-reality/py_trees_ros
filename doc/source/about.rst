About
=====

ROS Py Trees extends the `Py Trees`_ package with wrappers, patterns
and debugging tools for use in ROS.

If you are new to behaviour trees, start with the py_trees
:ref:`Sphinx Documentation <pt:introduction-section>`, browse
through a few of the readings and try the demos contained therein.

The :ref:`py-trees-ros-tutorials-section` section walks through the incremental development
of a behaviour tree layer for a robot.
