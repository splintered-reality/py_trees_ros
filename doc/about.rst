About
=====

This package extends `py_trees`_ with behaviours, idioms, a tree manager
(with ROS api) and command line tools for use in a ROS ecosystem.
The documentation in this package is useful for referential purposes only - it
includes the module level api documentation and instructions for the
command line utilities.

behaviour trees, refer to:
