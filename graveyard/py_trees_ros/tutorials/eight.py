About
^^^^^

The previous tutorial enables execution of a specific job, 'scanning' upon request.
However, as you start expanding the scope of your development,
you will need to start handling use cases with increasing complexity.

1. Multiple jobs at different priorities, Job A > Job B > Job C
2. Multiple jobs but execution is exclusive, Job A, B, if Job A is running, reject requests for Job B
3. Same core tree, but different jobs on different robots, Job A, B on Robot A, Job C on Robot B
4. Alter the list of permitted jobs dynamically, Job A on Robot A, later Job A, B on Robot A

The first use case is not as common as you'd expect - more often than not
a robot must follow a job through from start to finish - higher
priority switching does not support this.

Here we demonstrate how to (naively) facilitate 2 and 3. A list of jobs destined to
run will be loaded at launch time, but subtrees are not inserted until execution
is requested, i.e. just in time. When an incoming request is received, the corresponding
subtree will be inserted if anoother subtree is not currently running. Once a subtree runs
through to completion, it will be pruned. Insertion and pruning happens in the window
between ticks.

An technical requirement that makes this implementation practical
is to decouple the dependencies on job providers so that your launch does not
become burdened by explicity dependencies on any and all jobs.
Applications should depend on the application launcher, not the other way around.

Tree
^^^^

The core tree is identical to that used in :ref:`tutorial-full-scenario`, but with the
job subtree removed.

.. graphviz:: dot/tutorial-eight.dot

Job Handler
^^^^^^^^^^^

The job subtree create method is moved out into a separate class. Potentially this could be a class
in another module, another package (i.e. decopuled from where the core subtree is defined.
The class includes additional machinery listening for triggers to initiate job subtree insertion
(and subsequently, execution).

.. graphviz:: dot/tutorial-eight-scan.dot

.. literalinclude:: ../py_trees_ros_tutorials/jobs.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 32-160
   :caption: py_trees_ros_tutorials/jobs.py#scan

Job Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^

Job handlers are loaded via a string at runtime. This ensures decoupling of the
the tree implementation from the job providers. **The SplinteredReality** class here
is responsible for setting up and tick tocking the tree.

.. literalinclude:: ../py_trees_ros_tutorials/eight.py
   :language: python

   :lines: 152-171
   :emphasize-lines: 3,8-9,15-19
   :caption: py_trees_ros_tutorials/eight.py#job_loading

Just in Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Job subtrees are inserted and pruned via the tree pre and post tick handlers.

.. note::

   This is done in the free window between ticks, but the checking/insertion/deletion
   logic could alternatively have been achieved from behaviours inside the tree.

.. literalinclude:: ../py_trees_ros_tutorials/eight.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 182-224

Running
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    $ roslaunch py_trees_ros tutorial_eight.launch --screen
